	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Name's Erik Lissel, and I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I am crazy about programming&nbsp;patterns
		and making code that has as low complexity as possible. I am currently very warm towards JavaScript and the
		functional patterns it enables.
		I work at a small digital business company in Ã–rebro, Sweden: <a href="https://impera.se">Impera</a>. When I'm
		not staring at a screen I enjoy: downhill&nbsp;skiing,
		tabletop&nbsp;games, and singing. I also do physical exercise several times a week to keep the mind and body
		sharp.</p>
