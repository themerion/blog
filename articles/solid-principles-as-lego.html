<p>If you follow the SOLID principles the different parts of your code should be understandable and interchangeable, much like lego bricks.</p>

#heading# Getting our priorities straight

<p>It is said that 80% of the cost of a system happens after the system is launched. Reasons for this could be new features, changes, operations, and bugs.</p>

<p>The implications are huge - it is not terribly important how quickly you can write code. What is important is how easily existing code can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understood</li>
    <li>Modified</li>
    <li>Re-used</li>
</ul>

#heading# Principles

<p>To guide us when making decisions on <b>how</b> to write code, we use principles. Juxtaposing different principles against each other helps us to understand the tradeoffs between different decisions.</p>

<p>The SOLID principles are well established in the OOP-community, and they consist of the:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>S</b>ingle responsibility principle</li>
    <li><b>O</b>pen/closed principle</li>
    <li><b>L</b>iskov substitution principle</li>
    <li><b>I</b>nterface segregation principle</li>
    <li><b>D</b>ependency inversion principle</li>
</ul>

#heading# The Single Responsibility Principle



<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom:50px;">
    <img src="bloated-classes.png" style="max-width: 100%" />
</div>

<p class="important-note">The practice of mindlessly adding functions or fields to an existing class will inevitably lead to bloat.</p>

#heading# A software design mindset

<p>It is important to follow the Single Responsibility Principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>. That could be summarized as:</p>

<p class="important-note">"A class should do one thing and do it well"</p>

<p>In other words, you need to look at the <u>role</u> of the class. How would your desired change affect the class' responsiblity?</p>

<p>Let's say you are creating a UI-component called <code>Heading</code>, responsible for displaying a large title text. Now, your desired change is for some headings to have icons. Adding an icon-field to the <code>Heading</code>-class will dilute its responsibilities! An alternative approach would be to create a new specialized class <code>HeadingWithIcon</code>.</p>

#heading# Specialization

<p>If the desired change is to define some <u>default behavior</u>, i.e: specialize an existing class: use <b>composition</b>.</p>

<p>For instance, let's say you have a <code>Logger</code> class that can print messages. Now you want some logs to be prefixed with their severity (warning, info, error, etc.):</p>

<pre style="background-color: #ccc">WARNING: Got a null value
ERROR: Ice-cream delivery sub-process crashed!
INFO: Ice-cream delivery will be late.
</pre>

<p>Instead of changing the existing <code>Logger</code>, create a new specialized class - <code>SeverityLogger</code></p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public class SeverityLogger {
    Logger _logger;

    public SeverityLogger(Logger logger) {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void Log(string message, Severity severity) {
        string sevStr = SeverityToString(severity);
        _logger.Log(sevStr + ": " + message, severity);
    }

    private string SeverityToString(Severity s) {
        return (
            s == Severity.WARNING ? "WARNING" :
            s == Severity.ERROR ? "ERROR" :
            s == Severity.INFO ? "INFO" :
            "UNKNOWN SEVERITY";
    }
}
</pre></code>

#heading# Extension

<p>If the desired change is to optionally <u>add</u> some extra data to an existing class, then extension might be a good choice (notice how "add" is in opposite to "specialize").</p>

<p>Let's say you have a menu structure set up, consiting of multiple <code>MenuItem</code>. Now, you would want to hide some items depending on the user's access level.</p>

<p>Instead of changing the existing <code>MenuItem</code>, create a new class <code>AuthorizedMenuItem</code> that extends <code>MenuItem</code>:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public class AuthorizedMenuItem : MenuItem {
    int _accessLevel;

    public AuthoriedMenuItem(int accessLevel, ...) {
        super(...);
        _accessLevel = accessLevel;
    }

    public boolean CanBeViewed(AccessLevel userAccessLevel) {
        return userAccessLevel >= _accessLevel;
    }
}
</pre></code>

<p>It should be noted that this use case is perhaps even more suited for <b>decorators</b> or instance meta-data (if your language supports it).</p>

#heading# Difficult cases

<p>Let's face it: you are likely to run into situations where you want a bit of specification AND some new functionality. In this case, <b>refactoring</b> is your best friend.</p>

<p class="important-note">Break out important common functionality into smaller classes or functions.</p>

<p><u>Some</u> code repetition is bound to happen, and <u>that is ok</u>.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a simple <code>Button</code>-class:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public class OldButton {
    public void SetOnClick(Action<>);
    public void SetText(string);
    public void Draw();
}
</pre></code>

<p>Now you sometimes want the button to display an icon as well as text. In this case, you could try to break out the outline and text-settings into its own class:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
/**
 * Superclass for drawing empty buttons
 */
public class BlankButton {
    public void SetOnClick(Action<>);
    public void Draw(); // Draw the outline and call DrawContents()

    // Open up for subclasses to do their own thing
    public virtual void DrawContents();
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
/**
 * Class for drawing a button with a text label
 */
public class TextButton : BlankButton {
    string _text;

    public TextButton(string text) {
        _text = text;
    }

    public override void DrawContents() {
        someDrawApi.drawText(_text);
    }
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
/**
 * Class for drawing a button with a text label
 * and an image icon
 */
public class TextIconButton : BlankButton {
    string _text;
    Icon _icon;

    public TextIconButton(string text, Icon icon) {
        _text = text;
        _icon = icon;
    }

    public override void DrawContents() {
        someDrawApi.drawText(_text);
        someDrawApi.drawImage(_icon);
    }
}
</pre></code>

#heading# The power of interfaces

<p>The drawback of using these methods (except extension) is that you can't use your new classes as drop-in replacements in existing code. If you existing code expects a <code>Logger</code>, you can't just provide a <code>SeverityLogger</code> without changing all the places using the <code>Logger</code>.</p>

<p>This is a great reason to try and use interfaces in your code from the start. If your code is depending on an interface <code>ILogger</code>, it is quite simple to make <code>SeverityLogger</code> confirm to that interface:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public interface ILogger {
    Log(string message, Severity severity);
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public class SeverityLogger : ILogger {

    // ...

    public void Log(string message, Severity severity) {
        string sevStr = SeverityToString(severity);
        _logger.Log(sevStr + ": " + message, severity);
    }
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
pubic class Application {
    ILogger _logger;

    public void Main() {
        _logger = new SeverityLogger(new ConsoleLogger());

        // ...aaand the rest of the application code can be unchanged :)
    }
}
</pre></code>

#heading# Don't be an idiot

<p>As stated in the beginning, carefully consider the desired responsibility of the class. Don't just go and implement a slew of nice design patterns just because you can.</p>

<p>Sometimes it makes perfect sense to straight up add functionality to an existing class. However, that decision should be dictated by software design, and not the need for change itself!</p>
