#heading# tl;dr

<p>Lists should never be allowed to be null, this is a code smell:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
if(myList != null)
{
	foreach(var item in myList)
	{
		// ...
	}
}
</pre></code>


#heading# The fail-fast principle

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">The fail-fast principle</a> states that it is better for a program to crash early, if it has encountered an erroneous state.</p>

<p>Imagine that class A generates a variable that has some kind of error.
	 If the error is unrecoverable, according to the fail-fast principle, it would be best if it were A's responsibility to throw an exception, or crash.</p>

<p>Let us also imagine the absolute opposite. Class A generates an erroneous value, that value is persisted in a NoSQL datastore.
	 Three months later you get weird bug reports from users. Good luck hunting down the source of the bug.</p>

<p>A program crashes with a NullPointerException only when you try to <u>access a member</u> of the null valued variable.
 Allowing unchecked nulls in the code violates the <b>fail fast principle</b>.</p>


 #heading# Can variable x be null...?

	<p>Looking at any code (that you did not write yourself 5 minutes ago), you always have to wonder: should I null check this? Can this variable be null?
		This is stealing focus from what you should be thinking: how can I achieve my clients' goals?</p>

	<p>The point above is even worse for <b>interfaces</b>:
	<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public interface IHouseRegister {
	House GetHouseByPostalCode(string code);
}

var house = houseRegister.GetHouseByPostalCode("AAA"); // AAA does not exist
	</pre></code>
		
	<p>Will it return null? An empty object? Will it crash? <i><u>Will other implementations of IHouseRegister behave the same way?</u></i></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nullable-reference-types">Nullable reference types</h2>

<p>If you are lucky enough to get to start a brand new dotnet core project: congratulations. By putting <span style="font-family: courier">&lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;</span> in your project file,
	the compiler will automatically disallow any variables from being null. That is, unless you specify their types with a ? at the end.</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
MyButton button = GetButton("xyz");
button = null; // Will not compile.
Log(button.Title) // No problem, button can never be null

MyButton? nullableButton = GetButton("xyz");
Log(nullableButton.Title); // Will not compile, we have to check for null!
if(nullableButton != null)
{
	Log(nullableButton.Value.Title); // Will compile
}
</pre></code>


#heading# Functional approaches

<p>In Haskell, every operation that might fail is wrapped in another object. We can use this approach too, to make the code more clear:</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
public struct Maybe&lt;T&gt; where T : class
{
	public T Value { get; private set; }
	public bool HasValue { get; private set; }

	public Maybe(T value)
	{
		Value = value;
		HasValue = (value != null);
	}
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
// Some service we provide
public Maybe&lt;string&gt; FindFirstCurse(string text)
{
	int cursePosition = text.IndexOf("darn");
	if(cursePosition > -1)
	{
		return new Maybe(text.Substring(cursePosition, 4));
	}
	return new Maybe(null);
}

// Using the service
var curse = FindFirstCurse("I dont give a darn");
if(curse.HasValue)
{
	Log($"You cursed: {curse.Value}");
}
else
{
	Log("You are an angel");
}
</pre></code>


#heading# Lists

<p>There is one existing type of objects which does not need to suffer from the null madness: different kinds of lists.
	If you think about it, a Maybe could be seen as a list with 0-1 elements. Let's look at looping:</p>
	
<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
var list = new List&lt;string&gt;();
var maybe = new Maybe&lt;string&gt;();

foreach(var s in list) {
	Log(s);
}

if(maybe.HasValue) {
	Log(maybe.Value);
}
</pre></code>

<p>Now imagine, during development the list is passed from somewhere else; and you get a <span style="font-family: courier">NullPointerException</span> on the foreach loop.
Your reflex might be to just add a null check, but that would be wrong.</p>

<code><pre class="prettyprint lang-csharp">
if(myList != null) // This belongs with the code initializing myList, not here
{
	foreach(var item in myList)
	{
		// ...
	}
}
</pre></code>

<p>Lists should never be allowed to be null. There is no purpose or point in it. Instead of adding a null check directly in the code, you should put in the work and track the source of the list.
It is clearly doing its job poorly.</p>

<p>The only place where a null-check would be appropriate is if you recieve the list from an external source. However, your first priority should then be to create an instance of a list anyway,
so that the rest of your program can trust lists to always be initialized.</p>
